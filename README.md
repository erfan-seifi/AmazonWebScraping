# Web Scraping

This repository contains Python scripts and tools for web scraping, designed to extract and process data from websites. It demonstrates how to use popular web scraping libraries such as `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`, and `Selenium` to scrape dynamic and static web pages.

## Features

- **Static Web Scraping**: Scrape data from static HTML pages using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Dynamic Web Scraping**: Handle JavaScript-rendered content using `Selenium` and WebDriver.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and process scraped data to be used for further analysis or storage.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the scraper to fit different website structures and data formats.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `selenium`
- `pandas` (optional, for data storage and manipulation)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


If you're using Selenium, you also need to install the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).


## Usage
### Static Web Scraping Example
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://example.com"
response = requests.get(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
# Extract data (example: all links)
links = soup.find_all('a')

for link in links:
    print(link.get('href'))

### Dynamic Web Scraping Example (Using Selenium)

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path="/path/to/chromedriver")
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Wait for page to load (if needed)
driver.implicitly_wait(10)

# Extract elements (example: scrape the title)
title = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "h1").text
print(title)

driver.quit()
